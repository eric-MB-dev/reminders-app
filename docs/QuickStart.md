# <center> Reminder System v1.0-beta: <br> QUICK START

1. **Adding and Editing Reminders**  
    * **Pick a Date:** Click the icon to bring up the calendar 
    * **Clear the Date:** Erase the date to change it to "TBD" 
    * **Pick a Day:** Choose a day to set the next closest date 
    * **Clear the Day:** Choose no-day (empty item at top) as
      an easy way to clear the date.
    * **Choose a Time:** Click the icon to bring up the time chooser.
      Hover over a time, then choose a :15 minute increment.
    * **Edit Date & Time:** Manually edit date & time, as needed


2. **"Critical" Flag**  
Click in the **"!"** column to mark a reminder as **Critical**. 
The entire row bolds, and the first line of your description stands out.


3. **Countdown Column**
The Countdown column gives you time remaing and a status report:  
    * "LATE" (Red): You missed the window within the last hour.  
    * "Over" (Red): The event time has passed today.  
    * "Past": For date-only milestones that occurred yesterday or earlier.  


4. **Configuration Options**  
   * Choose your preferred date & time formats
   * Choose a smaller font to save space, or a larger one for easier reading
   * Choose the number of lines to display for a reminder, 
     so rows stay narrow to conserve space, or expand to show notes
     you've added.
