# Reminder System: Quick Start

1. **The "Speed-Dial" Time Picker**  
Don't type. Right-click any Time cell to access the surgical time-picker.
On the Hour: Hover over the hour and click to set an :00 appointment instantly.
Precision Offsets: Slide right to snap to :15, :30, or :45 increments.
Remove Time: Click "No Time" at the top of the menu to convert an appointment into an all-day event.


2. **Fluid Date Management**  
Dates are dynamic. Use the Date Column right-click menu to:
Snap to Today/Tomorrow: One click to move a looming task.
Pick a Date: Use the calendar for long-range planning.
Clear Date: Select "No Date" to move the item into your "General Tasks" pool (it will move to the bottom of the list, out of your way).


3. **The "Critical" Signal**  
Toggle the "!" icon (or click the description) to mark a row as Critical.
Visual Pop: The entire row bolds, and the first line of your description stands out.
Auto-Center: Single-line critical items stay perfectly centered, while multi-line notes hang from the top for easy reading.


4. **Smart Status Labels**
The Countdown column isn't just a timer; it’s a status report:  
"LATE" (Red): You missed the window within the last hour.  
"Over" (Red): The event time has passed today.  
"Past": For date-only milestones that occurred yesterday or earlier.  
"..." (Elide): If you see an ellipsis in the description, there’s more to the story. Hover or Edit to see the full notes
