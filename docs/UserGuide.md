# <center> Reminder System v1.0-beta: <br> USER GUIDE

## Why Another Reminders App?

### Motivation
Most modern "notification" systems are designed to appear 
and then disappear. If you aren't glued to the screen at 
that exact moment, the reminder is effectively lost. This 
app was born from the frustration of one too many missed events
occasioned by such "notifications".

### The "Half-Life" Solution
The only infallible reminder system I ever found is a series of 
escalating alerts based on a "half-life" philosophy:

1. **Long-Range:** A 4-week reminder for distant events.
2. **Mid-Range:** Closing that alert triggers a 2-week, 
   then a 1-week reminder.
3. **Sprints:** As the event nears, alerts escalate to 
   3 days, 1 day, 2 hours, etc. Becoming increasingly frequent 
   until it gets down to the final 5 minutes.

That system creates a persistent awareness that requires user 
interaction to dismiss or reschedule, ensuring that "out of sight" 
never becomes "out of mind."

## How the App Can Help You

The app has a number of features designed to help you stay 
"calendrically-oriented", so you never unintentionally miss an
appoitment or activity, ever again.

### Increase Date Awareness
The system prominently displays **Today's Date** to increase daily 
date-awareness. This anchor helps you relate upcoming 
reminders to the current moment.

### Critical-event flag
To make sure an important activity or event is prominently displayed,
click in the "Critical" ("!!") column to the left of the item 
description.

### Smart Date Entry
When entering an event, choosing a **Day of the Week** will 
automatically calculate the next occurrence of that date. 
* To erase a date quickly, simply choose **"None"** from the top 
  of the day-selector list.
* Dates and times remain fully editable at any time.

### The Countdown Column
The **Countdown** column is the heart of the system. It translates 
meaningless dates into actionable timeframes. 
* You aren't just told the "date", but can see at a glance if it 
  it is next week, next month, tomorrow, etc..

### Special Handling for items "Today" and "Tomorrow"
* Imminent events get attention-grabbing bold, colored, and ALL-CAPS
  styling.

### Automatic Sorting
* Items are sorted by urgency.
* TBD items (those with no date assigned) are pinned to the top 
  so they aren't forgotten in the "noise" of the future.

## Background 
As a charter member of the "calendrically-challeged", I have been
known, on at least two occasisons, to show up a week early for an 
event, only to miss it on the day of! 

When calendars gave me *persistent* notifications, I managed to keep  
track of important events by implementing manual "half-life" alerts. 
(When an alert appeared, I halved the time remaining and scheduled the
*next* alert right then, while I was thinking about it.)

That system worked well enough for me that there was a period of 
several years in which (unusually) I never unintentionally missed an
appointment, event, or activity (a feat for which I probably deserve 
a medal).

People who refer to their calendars _frequently_, undoubtedly have 
no need of such a system. But those of us who _don't_ open a calendar
regularly are all too likely to forget something they intended to 
attend or engage in. 

Since calendars weren't working as well as they used to, I generally 
resorted to keeping upcoming events in my ToDo/Task/Action-Item list.
But that approach had important drawbacks:
 * Reminders had to be manually sorted
 * Repeat-events had to be manually reschduled
 * There were no alerts of any kind, ever

Finally, I decided to create a date-based list system that sorted
reminders automatically and give me the kinds of alerts I so desperately
need to keep my life on track, automating the "half-life" system in 
process.

That is the ultimate goal of the Reminder System.
